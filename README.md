# OpEngine Monorepo PoC

This is the OpEngine monorepo Poc and playground for experiments.

## Pre-requisites

Make sure you have Node >=18 and PNPM installed globally on your system.

## Installation

Install the project with:

```sh
pnpm install
```

### Apps and Packages

- `eslint-config-custom`: `eslint` configurations (includes `eslint-config-next` and `eslint-config-prettier`)
- `tsconfig`: `tsconfig.json`s used throughout the monorepo

Each package/app is 100% [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/).

### Utilities

This Turborepo has some additional tools already setup for you:

- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) for static type checking
- [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) for code linting
- [Prettier](https://prettier.io) for code formatting

## Build

To build all apps and packages, run the following command:

```
pnpm build
```

To build a specific app or package, use the `--filter` option (can be stacked):

```
pnpm build --filter=website1

or

pnpm build --filter=website1 --filter=opengine-components
```

## Develop

To develop all apps and packages, run the following command:

```
pnpm dev
```

To develop a specific app or package, use the `--filter` option (can be stacked):

```
pnpm dev --filter=website1

or

pnpm dev --filter=website1 --filter=opengine-components
```

### Releasing a package (Example workflow, not tested yet!)

> [Changesets](https://github.com/changesets/changesets) is a tool to manage CI package deployments and changelog.

1. Run `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile` to install all dependencies
2. After you've made your changes, run `pnpm changeset`
3. Select the packages which have changes you want to commit, select the version that they should be bumped by and write a summary for the changes
4. Commit the file generated by `changeset` along with your changes in the feature branch
5. When ready to merge into `main`, a new PR should be created with an update to the changelog of each selected package
6. When this PR is merged into main, your changes will be packaged & published into the specific package repository
